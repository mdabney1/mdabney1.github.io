            <h2 class='resumeheader'> Motivation </h2>
            <p class='motivation'> Culture and family background have always influenced the way I see the world. They help me to be more open-minded and more aware of the people and situations around me. Being African American has opened up a lot of challenges but also an open and accepting culture and community. I see the world as though it is multiple parts that make a whole instead of just a single part. Individual people make the world and the communities and countries in it. Everyone brings their own unique perspective and ideas to the different situations we encounter every day. Everyday what I've learned, and what I'm currently learning, motivates me to make the world a better place and leave a lasting impact on the people I meet. </p>
